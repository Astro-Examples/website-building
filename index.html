    <h1>Welcome to Software Journal Club</h1>
    <h2>Session 3.a | Building a Website</h2>
    <p>Today we're going to be building a website in several stages. To start with this folder, run:</p>
    <p>
    git clone <a href="https://github.com/Astro-Examples/website-building.git">https://github.com/Astro-Examples/website-building.git</a>
    in a directory of choice.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover the basic files and structuring of a website that uses HTML, CSS, and (sometimes) a bit of JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Learn the basic syntax for html, such as <i>Italics</i>, <b>bold</b>, headings, <a href="#">links</a>, and images.</li>
      <li>Learn the basics of syling with CSS.</li>
      <li>Learn how to import and use simple elements from the Bootstrap Library</li>
      <li>Finally, how to take an html/css theme, and replace/modify things until it is a site you are happy with.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Following Along</h2>
    <p>You can edit the html/css files in whatever text editor you prefer. To visualize the webpage you're creating, you can simply double click to open in your default web browser.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, to use VSCode as I am here, install the "<b>Live Preview (Microsoft)</b>" extension to VSCode. If you do, you'll see changes to the file happen in real time. </p>
